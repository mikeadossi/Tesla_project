        "Tesla may be one of the newer car companies in the country, but they are considered the second oldest publicly listed American Automaker (the first is Ford). This is because General Motors went bankrupt, and Chrysler is privately owned.",
        
        "Teslas have a hefty price tag, but many feel they pay for their worth because of the car’s composition. Not only can car buyers save on gas, but the automobile makes it so that drivers only have to replace the tires and windshield wipers routinely; nothing else needs regular replacement.",
        
        "In 2017, intense hurricanes rocked the nation of Puerto Rico, and many people were left without electricity. Musk heard about a children’s hospital that was without power, and within a month he delivered 700 solar panels to the hospital where 3,000 children and 35 chronically ill patients resided.",
        
        "Tesla has a ridiculous amount of patents. But instead of keeping their secrets to themselves, Tesla allows other companies to use their designs and principles. The hope is that other car manufacturers will expand the reach of electric vehicles and develop their own.",
        
        "Driving over rough terrain and potholes can be a drag. Engineers at Tesla sympathized with drivers and installed self-adjusting suspension capabilities. This means that the Model S remembers roads that drivers have traversed, and will automatically lift the car when faced with this terrain again. Like, what?",
        
        "Tesla cars are developed to be largely regenerative. That means, thanks to the braking mechanism and rechargeable battery, you’re unlikely to ever need to go replacing common bits and pieces for your vehicle. In fact, it’s rare you’ll need to repair anything beyond the wheels!",
        
        "Tesla really started coming to public attention in 2006, but they’ve actually been around since 2003. It was in ’06 when the company first revealed the Roadster, their landmark vehicle that’s continuing to turn heads.",
        
        "If you were using social media or following the news in February 2018, you might remember there being a few photos of an astronaut dummy ‘driving’ a Roadster around the Earth’s orbit. The photos are real – as Musk’s other firm, SpaceX, had a hand in sending ‘Starman’ into orbit. You can track Starman here!",
        
        "Tesla cars are noted for being some of the safest on the planet. In fact, Elon Musk has outwardly claimed that the Model 3 is THE safest car on the road. The CEO often shares safety testing data for all to see via Twitter.",
        
        "Tesla has an open patent policy. It’s true! Tesla has made many of its designs and patents open source, which means anyone can use them to their own ends.",
